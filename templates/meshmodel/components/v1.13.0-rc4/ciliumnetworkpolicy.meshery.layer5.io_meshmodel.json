Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \\n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds).
